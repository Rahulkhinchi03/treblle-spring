Treblle makes it super easy to understand whatâ€™s going on with your APIs and the apps that use them. Just by adding Treblle to your API out of the box, you get:

- Real-time API monitoring and logging
- Auto-generated API docs with OAS support
- API analytics
- Quality scoring
- One-click testing
- API management on the go
- and more...

## Requirements

- Spring Boot 2.4.X
- Java 8+

## Installation

Add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.treblle</groupId>
        <artifactId>treblle-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Getting started

Next, create a FREE account on <https://treblle.com> to get an API key and Project ID. After you have those simply initialize Treblle in your project like so:

Annotate the desired configuration with `@EnableTreblle`

```java
@EnableTreblle
@SpringBootApplication
public class MyApplication {
    ...
}
```

Configure the following properties:

```csv
treblle.apiKey=<API_KEY>
treblle.projectId=<PROJECT_ID>
```

That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project. Now you get features like: auto-documentation, real-time request/response monitoring, error tracking and so much more.

### Running Treblle only for certain URL patterns

By default, Trebble applies its filter on the default URL pattern (/*). If you want to run Treblle only for certain URL patterns, you can define a list of patterns by using the `treblle.urlPatterns` configuration property like in the example below.

```csv
treblle.urlPatterns=/greeting,/goodbye
```

### Need to hide additional fields?

If you want to expand the list of fields you want to hide, you can pass field names you want to hide by using the `treblle.maskingKeywords` configuration property like in the example below.

```csv
treblle.maskingKeywords=secretField,highlySensitiveField
```

### Logging error bodies

The Spring default behavior is to handle errors via the `/error` endpoint. To allow Treblle to properly process your error response bodies you should switch to controller based exception handling, for example by using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` ( https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc )
